# Integer Counting Demo

Created 10/25/2022

This is an assignment for CSC 145 that I wrote code for. This program prompts the user to input an arbitrary number of integers between -50 and 50. The program then takes the input, creates an array, then outputs the number of values of each array with "*" and "|" every 5th count. This is displayed alongside the value. More specific directions can be found in the project directions.

Use Cases: 

 - Learning the fundamentals of arrays and arithmetic of if, else, and for loops

Problems:

 - Breaks when entering in any letters or anything other than a number, I did not account for this.
